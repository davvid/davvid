* [Git Cola](https;//github.com/git-cola/git-cola) is the best Git GUI in the free world.

* [Garden](https://github.com/garden-rs/garden) grows and cultivates collections of Git trees.
Garden is a simple yet expressive command runner and multi-repo Git configuration tool.
Garden helps you create development workflows over collections of self-contained,
loosely-coupled and inter-dependent Git worktrees.

* [jsonpickle](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpicle) is a Python library for
converting Python objects to and from JSON. Jsonpickle can take almost any Python
object, convert the object into JSON, and reconstitute the object back into Python.
Originally created by [johnpaulett](https://github.com/johnpaulett).
Maintained by [davvid](https://github.com/davvid) since 2008.
Co-maintained with [Theelx](https://github.com/Theelx) since 2021.

* [telescope-git-selector.nvim](https://github.com/davvid/telescope-git-selector.nvim)
is a Neovim Telescope extension that searches for Git worktrees and opens files in the
selected worktree.

* [telescope-git-grep.nvim](https://github.com/davvid/telescope-git-grep.nvim) is a
Neovim Telescope extension for searching using "git grep".

* [gcd](https://github.com/davvid/gcd) is a Git worktree navigator.
`gcd` lets you quickly navigate to Git worktrees on your filesystem.
`cdg` lets you quickly navigate to directories within your current worktree.

* [harpoon-term.nvim](https://github.com/davvid/harpoon-term.nvim) is a Neovim plugin
for quickly jumping between terminals inside Neovim. Harpoon-term is standalone version
of the `harpoon.term` module from Harpoon v1 with support for floating windows.

* [mockfs](https://github.com/mockfs/mockfs) is a simple mock filesystem for use in
Python unit tests.

* [ptex-bind](https://github.com/vfx-rs/ptex-bind) is a Rust crate that provides
high-level cxx-based bindings for [Ptex](https://github.com/wdas/ptex).

* [mutuple](https://github.com/davvid/mutuple) is a hack/joke Python package
that lets you replace items in "immutable" Python tuples.

* [vx](https://github.com/davvid/vx) runs commands inside Python virtualenvs.
`vx` is a simpler and faster `vex`.

* [python-jsonrpc](https://github.com/davvid/python-jsonrpc) is a modern python-jsonrpc
implementation, originally a mirror of jsonrpc.org, forked from the original package
by [bmjames](https://github.com/bmjames).

* [jsonaxe](https://github.com/davvid/jsonaxe) is a powerful command-line JSON processor
with an expressive Pythonic interface.

* [wildmatch](https://github.com/davvid/wildmatch) is a BSD-licensed C/C++ library for
git/rsync-style pattern matching. wildmatch is an extension of function fnmatch(3) as
specified in POSIX 1003.2-1992, section B.6.

* [distcc-docker-image](https://github.com/davvid/distcc-docker-image) is a Docker image
for a Debian/testing `distccd` worker node.

* [pycachegrind](https://github.com/davvid/pycachegrind) lets you visualizes Python
`cProfile` data using `kcachegrind`.


## Projects Co-Maintained by davvid

* [yaml-rust2](https://github.com/Ethiraric/yaml-rust2) is a pure Rust YAML implementation,
co-maintained with [Ethiraric](https://github.com/Ethiraric). This crate is a merge of
the [original yaml-rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-rust),
davvid's [yaml-rust-davvid](https://crates.io/crates/yaml-rust-davvid) fork, and Ethiraric's fork.

* [partio](https://github.com/wdas/partio) is a C++ library with Python bindings for
easily reading/writing/manipulating common animation particle formats such as PDB, BGEO,
PTC. Partio was created by [aselle](https://github.com/aselle) during his tenure at
[wdas](https://github.com/wdas).

* [Ptex](https://github.com/wdas/ptex) is a C++ library for Per-Face Texture Mapping for
Production Rendering. Ptex was created by [brentb](https://github.com/brentb).


## Projects Contributed to by davvid

* [git](https://github.com/git/git) is the best version control software in the world.
[davvid](https://github.com/davvid) is the original author of
[git difftool](https://public-inbox.org/git/20081226013021.GA15414@gmail.com/).
davvid helped maintain [git difftool](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool) and
[git mergetool](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool) into the 2010s.

* [saphyr](https://github.com/saphyr-rs/saphyr/) is set of crates dedicated to parsing YAML.

* [neovim-qt PR 1101](https://github.com/equalsraf/neovim-qt/pull/1101) is where davvid
updated `neovim-qt`, a Qt-based Neovim GUI, to avoid a flashing window blink on startup.

* [PaperWM PR 787](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM/pull/787) is where davvid added
"loop" variants of the Window navigation hotkeys to the popular Gnome tiling window
manager extension.

* [black](https://github.com/davvid/black) is davvid's fork of black where the
`--single-quotes` feature was added for preferring single quotes over double quotes.
Black's maintainers [refused to merge](https://github.com/psf/black/pull/633) the
`--single-quotes` option. My fork's `single-quotes` branch contains this unmerged feature.
Others agreed with my good taste, eventually leading to the creation of
[cercis](https://github.com/jsh9/cercis), which is a better code formatter than `black`.
